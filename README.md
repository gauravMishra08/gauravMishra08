> **Visual Update:**  
A subtle animation is added using `CSS` to make the design visually appealing and interactive. Here's how to add it:
```css
@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
}

.animated-icon {
  animation: float 3s infinite;
}
